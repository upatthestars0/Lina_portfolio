1. run this in a terminal to start:
npx create-next-app@latest website-name-here
cd lina-portfolio
npm run dev

-> then you'll have this:

 ├─ layout.tsx      → global layout
 ├─ globals.css     → styles
components/         → reusable UI blocks
public/             → images


create

  ├─ layout/
  ├─ sections/
  └─ ui/


export default function Hero() {
    return (
        <section className="space-y-6">
